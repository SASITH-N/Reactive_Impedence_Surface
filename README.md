## Introduction

The project presents a circularly polarized Wi-Fi antenna that incorporates the principle of Reactive Impedance Surface (RIS) to enhance the antenna's bandwidth and overall performance. Wi-Fi applications require efficient antennas, and this project seeks to meet those demands with a well-designed solution.

## Antenna Design and RIS Integration

### Antenna Design

The antenna design is based on a pentagonal patch, which serves as the conventional antenna structure. To broaden the bandwidth and enhance performance, the pentagonal patch is augmented with the Reactive Impedance Surface (RIS) principle.

### RIS Integration

The key features of the RIS layer include:
- A 2x2 array of single cell structures operating at around 5.3 GHz.
- A completely reactive impedance plane with a specified surface reactance that can be adjusted relative to perfect magnetic and electric surfaces.

## Antenna Performance

The integration of the RIS layer results in significantly improved antenna performance, including:
- Return Loss: 46.5333 dB
- Gain: Up to 5.63 dBi
- VSWR: Approximately 0.0819
- Impedance Bandwidth: 6.61%
- Radiation Efficiency: 76%

## Benefits and Applications

The circularly polarized Wi-Fi antenna with Reactive Impedance Surface (RIS) offers several advantages, including:
- Enhanced Bandwidth: The RIS integration widens the antenna's bandwidth, allowing for better data transmission and reception capabilities.
- Miniaturization Factor: The optimal use of RIS results in a miniaturized antenna design, making it suitable for compact and space-constrained applications.
- Improved Performance: The RIS layer not only enhances the bandwidth but also improves other important antenna parameters like return loss, gain, and VSWR, leading to superior overall performance.

This antenna is ideal for Wi-Fi applications, particularly in scenarios where a circularly polarized signal is required, such as wireless communication, IoT devices, and various other wireless connectivity applications.
